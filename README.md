## User Guide

This guide explains how to use the different features of the SuperMegaUltra tracker - available on github pages [here](https://tonykennah.github.io/SuperMegaUltra/) 

### Statistics View

At the top of the screen, you will see a "Statistics" section. For each item (represented by an emoji), this view provides four key pieces of information:

*   **Top-Left**: The **Actual Count** of how many times you have entered that number.
*   **Top-Right**: The **Expected Count**, which is the statistically expected number of hits for the current total number of entries.
*   **Bottom-Left**: The **Difference** between the actual and expected counts. Green indicates you are above the expectation, and red indicates you are below.
*   **Bottom-Right**: The number of entries **Since Last Hit**.

### Adding Numbers

You can add numbers to your history by clicking on any of the emojis in the "Add" section. This is the fastest way to add an entry.

### History & Settings

Below the main sections, you will find the **History** log and settings controls.

*   **History**: Displays a list of all the numbers you have entered, with the most recent entries appearing first. The number `0` (⬆️) is tracked in the statistics but is not displayed in this list.
    *   **To remove an item**, simply click on its emoji in the history list.
*   **Dark Mode**: Use the toggle switch to turn dark mode on or off. Your preference is saved automatically.
*   **Clear Button**: Click this button to clear all saved data from the application's storage. A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental data loss. After clearing, you will need to reload the app to start with a fresh state.
